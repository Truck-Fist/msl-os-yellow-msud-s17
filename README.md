### Overview
This program takes in a text file with a single line of words separated by spaces and will, one by one, load each word into a node in a binary tree. It will count how many times a particular word occurs and will include that count in the output file.

If the input file is named **input01.txt** the output file created by the program will be **output01.txt**.
The output file will look something like this:
```
apple: 1
car: 3
door: 1
tiny: 2
zebra: 1
```
The words will be sorted with the count placed next to it.
